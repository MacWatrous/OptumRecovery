# OptumRecovery
A rough physical therapy portal between doctors and paitents.

This project was for a hackathon that was based on health and required my team of four people to implement our own API. We created a paitent-doctor portal for the physical therapy industry which would allow paitents to better track their recovery, exercises, and appointments, and communicate updates to their doctor. We created several API endpoints for a customer and exercise database that we consumed ourselves to serve up login ID specific info.
